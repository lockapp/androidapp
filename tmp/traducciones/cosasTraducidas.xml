    <string name="r0">This app is free, no ads and you can find the source code on &lt;a href=https://github.com/lockapp/androidapp>github&lt;/a>. If you think it was useful it would be good that you send some money for coffee. Donate is an the best way to contribute with new features, every little bit counts.\n  Below you can find some FAQs</string>

    <string name="q1">Is safe Lock?</string>
    <string name="r1">The short answer is yes\nBut in reality it is a little longer, in many parts of the application speaks to block because many users are not related to terms like encrypt, but what really happens is that your data encrypted using AES, the same state-of-the-art encryption algorithm used as the national standard in the United States. 1Password uses 128-bit keys for encryption, which means that it would take millions of years for a criminal to decrypt your data using a brute force attack.</string>

    <string name="q2">Are my data well protected?</string>
    <string name="r2">Unlike other applications Lock has just one permission. It can only access external storage (SD Card) to encrypt your files. It has no access to the internet, SMS or other networks. Therefore Lock has no way to send your data out of your phone.\nFurthermore Lock code is hosted on github and who wants to can him..</string>

    <string name="q3">Can I share encrypted images?</string>
    <string name="r3">Yes, If to share an encrypted image you have to open it and find the share icon in the action bar of the Lock image viewer.\n Currently this is the only way to do this, because many applications when you send images downsize so the encrypted content is lost. But we are working on improving this experience.</string>
